

Britain needs Reform and Reform needs you. 
Britain has so much potential. Our country is full of talent and energy. Brexit is the opportunity of a lifetime. Yet the challenges we face are vast. Both Labour and Tory governments have broken promise after promise. They have destroyed trust in our democracy and let down the British people. 


Our Contract is not just another party manifesto. It sets out the reforms that Britain needs in the first 100 days following a general election, and thereafter. It has been produced with advice from a range of independent economists, think tanks and advisers on savings and costings. 
Costings can be found at the end of each policy section. Some policy areas come with net costs and

Government spending needs major reform. 
Government spending has increased by nearly £200 billion per year since 2019. Some 600,000 more people work in the public sector. What is the result? Outcomes are far worse, growth is down and people are receiving a worse service from the public sector, where performance has collapsed. The idea that Our economy needs Reform, to become high growth, with high wages, and lower taxes. We must make work pay. 



Smart tax cuts create growth and pay for themselves. That means more money to invest in reformed public services. It is called the Multiplier Factor. Instead, the government has hit us with the highest tax 



Reform is urgently needed to enjoy a high growth, high wage, low tax economy that is critical for Britain’s future. This cannot be emphasised enough.  Smart tax cuts create growth and pay for themselves year after year. That means more money to invest in reformed public services. The Multiplier Factor. 





Our immigration system needs urgent Reform. 
Uncontrolled mass immigration has pushed Britain to breaking point. A record 1,250,000 immigrants entered the UK in 2022. That is a city the size of Birmingham. Data is expected to show a similar number arrived in 2023 and probably 2024. New government figures say that almost 14 million people will arrive in the UK between 2021 and 2036. That is almost 1 million per year. The population explosion has led directly to the depression of local wages, the housing crisis and the NHS waiting list crisis. British culture, identity and values are under threat. 
In 2022 over 45,000 illegal immigrants crossed the channel in small boats, followed by some 30,000 in 2023. Most were allowed in with no criminal checks. Over 17,000 have gone missing.  Foreign criminals and terrorists walk our streets. Record numbers of asylum claims have been granted, increasing the magnet factor to the UK. Labour and the Tories will never control our borders. The British people have been lied to, ignored and betrayed. 
Critical reforms needed in the first 100 days: 

Freeze Non-Essential Immigration. 
Smart immigration can target the essential skills our economy needs such as doctors, nurses and successful business people, earning above the average salary. 


Stop the Boats with our 6 Point Plan. 
Recognise a National Security Threat. Leave the European Convention on Human Rights; Zero Illegal Immigrants to be Resettled in the UK; Offshore Processing for Illegal Arrivals; New Department of Immigration; Pick up Migrants out of Boats and Take Back to France. (We are legally allowed to do this under international treaties). 

Secure Detention for all Asylum Seekers. 
Asylum claims that arrive through safe countries will be processed rapidly offshore in British Overseas Territories. This will stop the scandal of undocumented asylum seekers 
absconding to work illegally or commit crime. 

Immediate Deportation for Foreign Criminals. 
Deport foreign nationals immediately after their prison sentence ends. Withdraw citizenship from immigrants who commit significant crimes. 

Restrict Student Dependents. 
Introduce new visa rules for international students and their dependents. Only international students with essential skills can remain in the UK when their study ends. Close down fake 
courses and abusive immigration schemes. 

Stop the Illegal Working Scandal. 
Local wages have been slashed because of cheap, undocumented, illegal labour that undermines British workers. The pro-immigration establishment has not enforced the rules. 
Significant penalties will be imposed on companies and directors that breach these rules. 


Our NHS needs urgent Reform. 

We must make it a national endeavour to get to Zero NHS Waiting Lists in 2 years. This can be done, but only with a fresh, bold, can-do approach. Healthcare must remain free at the point of use. 
Whilst we treasure some of the front line care provided by the NHS, we must be honest. The NHS is in crisis: patients are suffering. Too often the care lets people down badly. Waiting lists are at record highs. Hospital beds have been cut from 300,000 to 141,000 while the population has grown by 20%. Hundreds die every week because of delays in Accident and Emergency. Ambulance waiting times are at record highs. This has contributed to an excess deaths crisis and some of the worst health outcomes in Europe. 
This is not about funding. Per head of population, NHS spending is similar to other western countries. Sadly, the NHS is being let down by incompetent management, bureaucracy, waste, cover-ups and scandals. The NHS has a crisis in leadership. This will take time to fix. It is about structure and motivation. 
Critical reforms needed in the first 100 days: 


Transform Doctor and Nurse Availability. 
All frontline NHS and social care staff to pay zero basic rate tax for 3 years. This will help retain existing staff and attract back many who have recently left. We want the best staff with patients, not in offices behind desks or retired. 

Use Independent Healthcare Capacity. 
Cut waiting lists by using UK & overseas providers. The vast majority do not mind who delivers the cure, we just want the pain gone. This independent sector includes many not for profit health providers that provide some of the best care. Organisations such as Nuffield Health and Marie Curie, which provides end of life cancer care are charities. We want to encourage more of these organisations to end the NHS crisis. 


Tax Relief of 20% on all Private Healthcare and Insurance. 
We will incentivise people who can afford to pay more. This will improve care for all as pressure on the NHS is significantly reduced. Those who rely on the NHS will enjoy faster better care. Independent healthcare capacity will grow rapidly, providing competition and reducing costs. Firms should be encouraged to offer staff health insurance – this will become standard. Labour will instead add VAT on independent healthcare, which will make the NHS worse off. 


Doctor and Nurse Training. 
End training caps for all UK medical students. Write off student fees pro rata per year over 10 years of NHS service for all doctors, nurses & medical staff. 



Thereafter: 

Put Patients in Charge With a New NHS Voucher Scheme.. 
Patients will receive a voucher for private treatment if they can’t see a GP within 3 days. For a consultant, the time limit would be 3 weeks. For an operation, 9 weeks. 

Cut Waste, Bureaucracy and Unnecessary Managers. 
Focus on results, not targets. Nail down better prices using economies of scale. Better IT for example. Review all Private Finance Contracts in NHS. Significant savings potential. Remove Lifetime Cap on NHS Pensions. This causes 70% of surgeons to reduce their hours. 

Save A&E. 
GP waiting lists are hitting A&E. Cut waiting times with a campaign of ‘Pharmacy First, GP Second, A&E Last’. More beds in A & E and other parts of the NHS are essential. 

Excess Deaths and Vaccine Harms Public Inquiry. 
Excess deaths are nearly as high as they were during the Covid pandemic. Young people are overrepresented. 


Our energy market needs Reform. 
We all care about the environment. Our air has never been cleaner. We want to use technology to do our bit. But Net Zero is the wrong bit, at the wrong price, in the wrong timeframe. Westminster’s obsession with Net Zero is damaging our livelihoods and the economy. It has sent energy bills soaring. Made it harder for businesses to compete. It is costing tens of thousands of jobs and increasing inflation. 
Net zero means reducing man made CO2 emissions to stop climate change. It can’t. Climate change has happened for millions of years, before man made CO2 emissions, and will always change. We are better to adapt to warming, rather than pretend we can stop it. Up to 10 times more people die of cold than warmth. In Roman Britain some 2,000 years ago, it was 2 degrees warmer than now. Grapes for wine were grown in Yorkshire. 
CO2 is essential for photosynthesis to enable plant growth. CO2 only represents 0.04% of the atmosphere; the average garden greenhouse has 3 times more! The UK produces only 1% of global CO2 emissions, yet China produces 27%. China & India are building hundreds of coal fired power stations. Even the IPCC admits Net Zero would make no difference to sea level rise for 200-1,000 years; in other words they do not have a clue. 
Instead, Net Zero sends our money abroad and damages critical industries like steel production. The government has turned Britain from being an exporter of oil and gas into a net importer. They have bet our future on unreliable wind and solar power and destroyed our energy security. It’s time for a common sense energy strategy. 
Critical reforms needed in the first 100 days: 


Scrap Net Zero and Related Subsidies. 
The UK cost of Net Zero has been estimated by the National Grid and others at some £2 trillion or more. It is so big that no one really knows. The public sector is spending billions 

each year with no accountability or transparency. Ditching Net Zero would save the public sector some £20 billion per year for the next 25 years, possibly more. 

Scrap Annual £10 Billion of Renewable Energy Subsidies. 
Achieve this through equivalent taxes on them. Renewables are not cheaper. Our bills have increased dramatically in line with the huge increase in renewables capacity over the last 
15 years. 

Cheap, Secure Energy. 
We must use the energy treasure under our feet. Start fast-track licences of North Sea gas and oil. Grant shale gas licences on test sites for 2 years. Then enable major production 

when safety is proven, with local compensation schemes. The value of shale gas is potentially hundreds of billions over 30 years to the taxpayer. This could transform our nations fortunes and ensure prosperity for generations to come. 
Thereafter: 

Cleaner Energy from New Technology. 
Fast-track clean nuclear energy with new small modular reactors, built in Britain. Increase and incentivise UK lithium mining for electric batteries, Combined Cycle gas turbines, clean 
synthetic fuel and clean coal mining. 


Law and Order urgently needs Reform. 
The government is soft on crime and police leadership is badly failing. The bobby on-the-beat is almost extinct. Paperwork wastes huge amounts of police time. Crime solving is at an all-time low. Charging rates have collapsed to around 5%. 
As a result, violent crime is at record highs. ‘County lines’ drugs gangs have spread across the UK. Teenage knife crime is out of control. Public confidence in the police is at an all-time low. The police must protect life, property and prevent crime without fear or favour. 
Critical reforms needed in the first 100 days: 

Commence Increase in Police Numbers. 
England and Wales have 235 police officers per 100k population. One of the lowest levels in Europe. France has nearly 300 police per 100k population. Commence recruitment to increase UK per capita police numbers to 300 per 100k population. That is 40,000 new front-line officers, over a 5 year parliament. 

Commence Zero Tolerance Policing. 
It worked in New York. Clampdown on all crime and antisocial behaviour. Prison for all violent crimes and possessing a knife. Half of acquisitive crimes are drug related. Dealing and trafficking will get mandatory life imprisonment. A new offence of Substantial Possession of Drugs will meet heavy fines. Increase Stop and Search Substantially. It is a proven deterrent to knife crime. 
New Police Leadership & Recruitment Regime. 
Strong preference for ex-military officers and personnel. 


More Bobbies on the Beat. 
Ensure that police return to the beat and use better technology to stop wasting time on paperwork. Visible policing stops crime before it starts. Allow PCSOs to become police officers before the role is phased out. 

Common Sense Policing not ‘Woke’ Policing. 
Scrap all Diversity, Equality and Inclusion roles and regulations to stop two-tier policing. Protect the public without fear of favour. Reform the The Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) so that the police complaints system works for the law abiding public. 



Thereafter: 

Scrap or Reform Police and Crime Commissioners. 
PCCs do not have sufficient power to make a difference. Yet some employ 30 staff. That could be 30 more police officers on the beat. Either they get the power to make a real change or they should go. 

De-Politicise the College of Policing. 
Instead, prioritise crime prevention, discipline, public service and high standards of strength and fitness. Replace degree-standard entry with an entrance exam. Require officers to complete a 2-year probationary period. 


Our Justice System needs Reform. 
It is failing the public. It is slow, bureaucratic and inefficient. It often puts offender rights above victim rights. Some violent repeat offenders commit over 100 offences, yet are still free to walk the streets. Over 75,000 defendants are awaiting trial at the Crown Court. The police are demoralised and the public are losing trust in the system. We will build a common sense justice system that keeps the public safe. 
Critical reforms needed in the first 100 days: 

Urgent Sentencing Review with Automatic Life Imprisonment for Violent Repeat Offenders. 
Those committing second violent or serious offences will receive mandatory life sentences. 


Increase the Criminal Justice Budget. 
The budget is almost the same as it was 10 years ago. Increase it from £10 billion to £12 billion to ensure more high calibre staff to cut delays. 

Change the Definition of Hate Crime. 
The CPS and police definition of a hate crime has led to systemic bias. Members of the British public must not be investigated because ‘any’ person ‘perceives’ that a hate crime has been committed. Proper evidence must be required. Enforce existing laws to stop violent, hate demonstrations such as the Free-Palestine marches. 

Commence building of 10,000 New Detention Places. 
Start expansion in capacity of state built and managed prisons so that life means life for those who endanger the public. Commission disused military bases if needed. 

Tackle Organised Crime. 
Foreign gang crime accounts for most organised crime in the UK at a cost of  £37 billion per year. This includes drugs, people trafficking and money laundering through barber shops, car washes and nail bars. Increase budget for both the National Crime Agency and The National Drugs Intelligence Unit. 



Thereafter: 

Reform the Child Maintenance Service. 
The CMS is failing children and parents. It should be  a Mediation Service and means-tested child support for parents who cannot arrange finances. Launch a special division of the family court for maintenance and defaults. Share parental care 50/50 where appropriate. Rights of access for Grandparents. 

Stop Child Grooming Gangs. 
Systematic child sexual abuse continues unchecked. Child Protection Services needs a dedicated National Agency working with local charities, councils and health services. Upgraded intelligence can identify high-risk children and filter malicious claims. 

Tackle Youth Crime. 
Reopen High Intensity Training Camps for young offenders to teach basic education, teamwork and values. Military veterans can provide role models. This model worked at Thorn Cross in the 1990s. It is needed more than ever. 


Too many children and young people are being badly let down. Discipline, disruption and violence are huge issues in class. Teachers are drowning in bureaucracy. Woke ideology is spreading through our schools and universities. We want an education system that ensures young people learn the skills, character and values to succeed in life. 
Critical reforms needed in the first 100 days: 


Ban Transgender Ideology in Primary and Secondary Schools. 
There are 2 sexes and 2 genders. It is a dangerous safeguarding issue to confuse children by suggesting otherwise. No gender questioning, social transitioning or pronoun swapping. Inform parents of under 16s about their children’s life decisions. Schools must have single sex facilities. 

Ban Critical Race Theory in Primary and Secondary Schools. 
It is unacceptable to divide children on grounds of race and teach them to be ashamed of their country. 


Tax relief of 20% on all Independent Education. 
No VAT on Fees: If parents can afford to pay a bit more, we should incentivise them to choose independent schools. This will significantly ease pressure on state schools, so improve education for all. Independent education capacity will grow rapidly, providing competition and reducing costs. 

Scrap Interest on Student Loans. 
Extend loan capital repayment periods to 45 years. Restrict undergraduate numbers well below current levels, too many courses are simply not good enough and students are being ripped off. Enforce minimum entry standards. Stop backdoor route to immigration through use of low quality degree courses. 



Thereafter: 

Cut Funding to Universities that Undermine Free Speech. 
The government's Free Speech Act is toothless. Allowing political bias or cancel culture must face heavy financial penalties. 

Permanent Exclusions for Violent and Disruptive Students. 
Double the number of Pupil Referral Units so schools can function safely. Disruptive children must also get support. 

Universities Must Provide 2 Year Graduate Courses. 
The option of 2 year courses would reduce student debt and allow earlier entry into employment to help pay it off. 

Increase Technical Courses and Apprenticeships. 
Value young people with vocational talents. Britain needs skilled workers in engineering, construction, IT and high demand sectors. 

Life Skills Classes at School. 
Subjects such as home economics and social media risk should be part of the school curriculum. No smartphones or social media in schools under 16. 


The benefits system is broken. There are 5.3 million people in Britain on out of work benefits. Around 3.7 million of these are not required to look for a job for health reasons. A substantial number are under 34 years of age. This number soared when face to face health checks were replaced by remote assessments. 
We want an efficient welfare system that helps the genuinely disabled, sick, vulnerable and unemployed to find work. Currently our benefits system encourages dependency and entitlement. This damages mental health, locks people into poverty and wastes talent. Low pay and high tax means many can earn more on benefits than in work. Meanwhile nearly a million job vacancies are unfilled. If you can work you must work. There are too many shirkers and skivers while many with disabilities work hard and pay tax. 
Critical reforms needed in the first 100 days: 


Make Work Pay. 
Lifting the income tax start point to £20,000 per year means an extra £1,500 per year. This would be a key incentive for those on benefits to find work. 


Start to Motivate up to 2 Million People Back to Work. 
Reforms to benefit support & training will help people back into work. Particular focus on 16-34 year olds. Employment is critical to improving mental health. Tax relief for businesses that undertake apprenticeships. 

Enforce a 2-Strike Rule for Job Offers. 
All Job seekers and those fit to work must find employment within 4 months or accept a job after 2 offers. Otherwise benefits are withdrawn. 

Face to Face, Not Remote Assessment for Personal Independence Payment. 
Human contact is critical to build relationships and coach people back into work. We will also require independent medical assessments to prove eligibility for payments. 


Thereafter: Integrate Mental Health Services with Job Seeking Pathways. 
Britain's young people are in the grip of a mental health crisis. Work is a cure not a cause. 

Stop Benefit Fraud. 
Overhaul anti-fraud practices to ensure the Department for Work and Pensions cut fraudulent benefit claims to negligible levels. 


Brexit meant taking back control of our borders, laws and money. It should have allowed us to take our rightful place among the 168 other sovereign nations that succeed outside the European Union. Brexit meant more democracy. More accountability. More freedom. 
Brexit is a great opportunity for which the government has so far failed to take advantage. They have not controlled our borders, not reduced taxes and unnecessary EU laws still hinder growth. The Brexit that 
17.4 million voted for, has been betrayed. An out-of-touch political elite is still obstructing the biggest democratic mandate in our history. 
Critical reforms needed in the first 100 days: 


Legislate to Scrap EU Regulations with Immediate Effect. 
British Laws on State Aid, Competition, Employment and the environment are still based on EU regulations. Nor have we reversed EU Net Zero laws which are sabotaging our economy. 



Leave the European Convention on Human Rights. 
British laws and judges must never be overruled by a foreign court. We must be free to deport those we consider a threat to our country. UK courts must be able to protect British citizens from EU arrest warrants. 

Abandon the Windsor Framework. 
This is worse than the original Northern Ireland Protocol. The UK has been partitioned down the Irish Sea. Northern Ireland is still in the EU’s single market for goods. British citizens in Northern Ireland are being ruled by EU laws. Now the Tories have agreed to align new UK laws with EU laws. 
Thereafter: 

Independence for Britain’s Armed Forces. 
The government has signed up to the EU Horizon programme. That means we send money to the European Defence Fund and part of the EU’s military mobility project. David Cameron met his EU counterparts to discuss EU defence policy. Our Armed Forces  are at risk of being sucked into an EU Command and Control Force. 

Prepare for renegotiations on the EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement. 
A so-called EU ‘level playing field’ is holding us back. 


Britain has some of the best and bravest Armed Forces in the world. Yet grandstanding politicians send our servicemen and women abroad with poor equipment. They have cut the Army to its smallest size in 300 years. Military housing is substandard. Our wounded and veterans are often abandoned. Some still face unjust legal claims. We will reform our military covenant so those who put their lives on the line get the support they deserve both during and after service. 
Critical reforms needed in the first 100 days: 


Increase Defence Spending to 2.5% of National GDP by year 3, then 3% within 6 years. 
This will increase the size and capacity of our armed forces, ensuring our lead role in NATO. Will improve equipment and boost morale in military communities. 


Introduce Urgent Pay Review. 
Increase basic pay across our armed forces to boost recruitment and retention. It is unacceptable that a private soldier is paid less than an Amazon worker. 

Introduce new Armed Forces Justice Bill. 
Protect our servicemen and women on active duty inside and outside the UK from civil law and human rights lawyers. The bill will also create an armed forces watchdog to fast-track complaints and appeals in housing and welfare. 

New, Dedicated Ministerial Department for Veterans. 
A properly funded and resourced whole department is essential. The next page has more detail. 

Thereafter: 

Regenerate Britain’s Defence Manufacturing and Technology. 
Introduce incentives and tax breaks to boost the UK defence industry. Improve equipment self-sufficiency and manufacture world class products for export. 

Reform Defence Procurement. 
Launch a Joint Acquisition Corp to ensure world class procurement. The Ministry of Defence must listen to soldiers on the front line and ensure they get the equipment they need. 

Education for Military Personnel. 
Free education both during and after service is vital to ensure a successful return to civilian life. 


Veterans are some of the nations’ greatest assets, not victims. They have a huge amount to offer. They should be valued, as well as thanked. Our veterans have valuable skills which should be used to their fullest potential after leaving the Armed Forces. Their leadership experience, logistics expertise, discipline, determination and can do attitude is unique. 
We must properly look after veterans who have been wounded and those suffering from health issues. Veterans should not be homeless. Access to pensions and grants must be quick and straight forward. 
These reforms are the fastest way to solve the Armed Forces recruitment crisis. People want to be part of a great lifelong successful team. 
Critical reforms needed in the first 100 days: 


Commence “You serve, You Deserve”. 
A fully recognised national rewards and benefits scheme for veterans and families including travel. 


Instigate “Veterans First” priority Status. 
For healthcare, housing, training and education, together with support for dependents. 

Preferential Qualification for Key Public Sector Leadership Roles. 
Such as Chief Superintendent of Police Forces, CEO / COO roles in hospitals amongst others. 
Thereafter: 

Take Back Control of Recruitment for Armed Forces. 
This has become a crisis due to woeful private sector outsourcing, bureaucracy and incompetence. Veterans can be best motivators for recruiting new people into the armed forces. 

Take Back Control of Military Accommodation. 
Poorly run and outsourced property management contracts have failed our armed forces. Thousands of homes are in poor condition or uninhabitable, which is inexcusable. 



The UK population has grown by over 1.3 million in just 2 years. Yet only 425,000 homes have been built. The Office of National Statistics forecast the population to grow by nearly 7 million between 2021 and 2036, putting huge pressure on housing. 
Mass immigration is the main factor in this. Other factors that have damaged housing supply are overly bureaucratic planning regulations that delay decisions and add huge cost. 
Critical reforms needed in the first 100 days: 


Review the Planning System. 
Fast track planning and tax incentives for development of brownfield sites, including unused offices and vacant high street properties. Review system of Section 103 Developer Contributions for infrastructure such as schools and surgeries to accelerate house building. 

Reform Social Housing Law. 
Prioritise local people and those who have paid into the system. In parts of the UK almost half of all social housing is occupied by someone born overseas. Foreign nationals must go to the back of the queue. Not the front. 

Scrap the 2019 Tax Changes for Landlords. 
The tax system should encourage smaller landlords into the rental markets. Not penalise them. 


Abolish the Renters’ (Reform) Bill. 
Existing legislation was adequate to address bad practices. Instead, we will boost the monitoring, appeals and enforcement process. 

Thereafter: Incentivise Use of New Construction Technology. 
Such as modular construction, and smart infrastructure. 

More Homegrown Qualified Traders. 
New apprenticeships and vocational courses will increase the supply of skilled, well-paid workers to replace cheap overseas labour. 



Britain has one of the highest family breakdown rates in the western world. In 2021, more children were born to unmarried couples than to those who were married. Half of all children grow up in separate households. We have the unhappiest teenagers in Europe. 
This has a devastating impact. On average, children from broken homes suffer from more educational failure, unemployment, homelessness and poverty. They suffer from more mental health issues, substance abuse, crime and imprisonment. This is a social and economic catastrophe that costs taxpayers tens of billions every year. 
Critical reforms needed in the first 100 days: 

Support Marriage Through the Tax system. 
Germany and France let married couples with children share their tax allowance. British married couples with children deserve the same. As soon as finances allow, introduce a UK 25% transferable marriage tax allowance. This would mean no tax on the first £25,000 of income for either spouse. (Based on our higher income tax starting point of £20,000 per person). This will help make work pay, helping people trapped on benefits back into the workplace so reducing the benefits bill. 

Choice for Stay at Home Mums or Dads. 
The majority of mothers would choose to stay at home more if they could. ‘Frontloading’ the Child Benefit system for children aged 1-4 would give parents the choice to spend more time with their children. 

Mandate Single Sex Spaces. 
Public toilets and changing areas must provide single sex facilities. 



Promote Child Friendly App Restricted Smartphones. 
Reduce social media harms for children. 

Thereafter: 

Launch inquiry into Social Media Harms. 
Social media is associated with eating disorders, anxiety, depression, suicide and the child mental health crisis. Critically, social media can change both behaviour and belief without the user's consent. Protect children’s mental health. (Potential social media ban for under 16s if practicable.) 

Review the Online Safety Bill. 
Social media giants that push baseless transgender ideology and divisive Critical Race theory should have no role in regulating free speech. 


Our Transport and Utilities Infrastructure has suffered from under investment and lack of joined up thinking. Much of it has been sold to overseas investors. Around 70% of water companies and 80% of our gas power stations and offshore wind farms are foreign owned, together with 100% of our nuclear power stations which are owned by EDF of France. 
Overseas shareholders get richer while prices have soared and the cost of living crisis rages. The regulators have been asleep at the wheel. Our infrastructure is crumbling. Risk of power cuts has increased. Raw sewage is pumped into our seas. Economic productivity has been damaged. We have given up control over much of our critical infrastructure, meaning national security is at risk. 

Critical reforms needed in the first 100 days: 

Scrap HS2. 
Save £25 billion by scrapping the rest of this bloated vanity project. 


Stop the War on Motorists. 
Legislate to ban all ULEZ and Low Traffic Neighbourhoods. We will scrap bans on selling petrol and diesel cars and scrap legal requirements for manufacturers to sell electric cars. 

Accelerate Already Announced Transport Infrastructure. 
Focus on the North. 

Thereafter: 

Tighter regulation and new ownership model for Critical National Infrastructure. 
Consumers have been ripped-off and failed by weak regulators. Launch a new model that brings 50% of each utility into public ownership. The other 50% would be owned by UK pension funds, benefiting from new expertise and better management. This is a win win situation. 

Integrated Transport Infrastructure. 
Launch a national database for councils, contractors, government and utilities to ensure coordination of projects. Less road works, waste and delays. 

National Water Grid and Reservoirs. 
The UK is at risk of water shortages. Build new reservoirs in high rainfall areas. Water can be stored and transferred to low rainfall areas when required. Stop the release of sewage into our rivers and seas. 

A Single Government Infrastructure Funding Stream. 
Overhaul and merge the National Infrastructure Commission and the Infrastructure Bank. Scrap all Net Zero related objectives. Simplify the funding process, save time, cut waste, boost funding and ensure accountability. 


British farming needs reform to take advantage of Brexit. 
Farming is in crisis and our food security is at risk. Government subsidies force farmers to meet environmental targets instead of producing food. Fuel and fertiliser costs have spiralled. Farmers have to deal with huge amounts of paperwork. Farmland is being lost to re-wilding and solar farms. High energy costs and supermarket price fixing has pushed many farmers to bankruptcy. Rural communities are dying. 
Critical reforms needed in the first 100 days: 


Increase the farming budget to £3 Billion. 
Focus on smaller farms. Keep farmland in use. Bring young people into farming. Boost rural economy and culture. Increase innovation and diversification. Help farmers to farm, not pay them to leave or retire. 

Scrap climate-related farming subsidies. 
Productive land must be farmed, not be used for solar farms or rewilding. Replace current subsidies with direct payments. Stop Natural England from taking action that damages farmers. 

Protect Country sports. 
These increase investment in conservation of our environment. They boost rural jobs, communities and local economies. 



Thereafter: 

Stop supermarket price fixing. 
Grant powers to the Competitions and Markets Authority to ensure fair pricing. Help farmers sell their produce directly to the public. Change planning laws to support farm shops with zero business rates. 

Buy British. Buy quality. 
Little more than half the food we consume is UK produced. Target 70% to ensure food security. Taxpayer funded organisations should source 75% of their food from the UK. Clear labelling for consumer choice. Boost smaller food processors and abattoirs through tax breaks and other incentives. This cuts transport costs and promotes animal welfare. 

Farming not form filling. 
Many farmers spend over 15 hours a week on paperwork. Cut red tape from HMRC and the British Cattle Movement Service. 

Future technology & fertiliser supplies. 
Farmers must have access to new technology to boost production and cut costs. UK food security also depends on fertiliser supply and production. 

Encourage young people into farming. 
Offer subsidised courses at Agricultural Colleges and apprenticeships to help young people learn farming ‘craft’ and business management. 


Brexit was a huge opportunity to renew our fishing industry and revive our coastal communities. Yet, the government has not taken back control of our historic fishing grounds. Foreign vessels still plunder our waters and damage the sea bed. Major renegotiations of our fishing arrangements with the EU are essential in the run up to the 2026 review. 
Coastal communities are blighted by crime, poverty and unemployment. Fishing ports such as Fleetwood, Grimsby, Hull, Lowestoft, Aberdeen are desperate for regeneration.  Fishing offers a unique opportunity to achieve this. Every one job at sea creates 8 jobs on the land through processing and support industries. Reform UK will restore the UK’s fishing industry and heritage. 
Critical reforms needed in the first 100 days: 


Stop EU Fishers Taking UK Quotas. 
End automatic access to UK Waters. Every foreign fishing vessel must pay for a licence to gain access to the UK’s 12 nautical mile zone. 


Expand the Royal Navy Overseas Patrol Squadron. 
Police British territorial waters properly. Assess the possibility of creating a dedicated coast guard or fisheries protection agency. 

Ban Foreign Supertrawlers from UK Waters. 
Extend the ban on pair trawling for bass beyond the South East and 12-mile territorial waters. 

Stop Foreign Owners Using a British flag of Convenience. 
Require tax and provenance tests. Ban the trading of fishing quotas. Revisit the 1988 Merchant Shipping Act and strengthen ‘Economic Link’ principles. Reform the quota system to benefit small scale fishing. 



Thereafter: 

Rebuild UK Fish Processing. 
Tax and other incentives to ensure that all fish caught in British waters are landed and processed in the UK. Fish caught by foreign vessels in UK waters should also be landed and processed here when capacity allows. 

Revitalise the UK’s Fishing Fleet. 
Tax incentives and vocational training to increase UK fishing fleets. Include fishing communities in policy making. 

Launch a Sovereign Wealth Style Coastal Fund. 
Proceeds from foreign fishing licences must be reinvested in coastal communities. 

Guarantee Sustainable Stocks. 
Implement a ‘dynamic management system’. Work with national and regional partners such as the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission. 
Negotiate with Ireland on Rockall. 
Establish a legal claim for EEZ. Secure territorial waters. 



Our elderly deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. For over 20 years the Tories and Labour  failed to tackle the issue of Pensions and Social Care. The system is broken and time is running out. Since the 1950s, larger numbers of young people have funded the smaller numbers of elderly through the tax system. But people are living longer and the percentage of over 65s to the working age population has increased. This change has caused a major funding problem for our elderly and long - term sick. 
Critical reforms needed in the first 100 days: 

Commence Royal Commission of Inquiry into Social Care System. 
A national plan is critical for a sustainable social care system. Collaboration between central government, local authorities, social care providers and home carer support groups is vital to solve the growing challenge. (Flexibility, income tax and VAT breaks are potential factors). Streamlining and simplifying through a single funding stream, not split between NHS ands Local Authorities is essential. Improved regulation is required for this vital service which is part of UK PLC’s infrastructure. Additional funding will be required when a national plan is agreed. 


Stop the Offshore Taxpayer Rip Off 
Some larger care home providers avoiding tax on hundreds of millions of profits through complex offshore property company structures and high interest shareholder loans. At the same time they pay minimal wages to front line care staff. 

Thereafter: 

Review Pension provision. 
The current pension system is riddled with complexity, huge cost and poor returns leading to lower pensions. Other nations like Australia do savings and pensions much better and 
cheaper than we do, from a much younger age. 

Pension and Social Care Reform: TBC 


The UK’s constitutional arrangements need Reform. 
We are ruled by an arrogant and out of touch elite. The two party system is broken. The social contract is broken. 
Our public sector is too often incompetent, wasteful and unaccountable. The Civil Service is no longer neutral. Many public institutions are pro-immigration, pro-remain and left-wing. Patronage around the House of Lords and honours system is leading to corruption in public life. 
We have a constitutional crisis and our freedoms are at risk. Millions are taxed without proper representation. The British public must have a real, democratic choice on how our country is run. 
Critical reforms needed in the first 100 days: 


Leave the European Convention on Human Rights. 
Commence reform of the Human Rights Act. 


Commence Reform of the House of Lords. 
Replace the crony-filled House of Lords with a much smaller second chamber. Structure to be debated. Immediate end of political appointees. 

Commence Reform of the Civil Service. 
Replace Civil Service leaders with private sector successful people, who are political appointees, who come and go with the government. Enforce the Civil Service code of integrity, honesty, objectivity and impartiality.  Ensure better value for money with proper, competitive tendering. 

Commence Reform of the Postal Voting System. 
Postal voting has allowed electoral fraud. We will stop postal voting except for the elderly, disabled or those who can’t leave their homes. 

Thereafter: 

Proportional Representation Voting for the House of Commons. 
First Past the Post is an outdated voting system. Large numbers of voters have no representation in parliament and new parties are shut out of the political system. Voter turnout would be some 10% higher with PR. A referendum is needed. 

A British Bill of Rights. 
Our freedoms must be codified and guaranteed. Political freedom, personal freedom, economic freedom. Never again can our entire country be locked down on shoddy evidence and lies. 


Reform is needed to defend and promote British culture, heritage and identity. ‘Woke’ ideology has spread fear through our captured public institutions. No one voted for uncontrolled mass immigration. Multiculturalism has led to the growth of separate communities that risk nurturing extremism and the rejection our way of life. Christian values are under threat. 
Labour and the Tories have broken their promises and treated us with contempt. Divisive laws promote minority interests over the majority. Two-tier policing has damaged trust in the police.  Freedom of speech has been undermined. Christians are arrested for expressing their beliefs in public. White people can even be barred from applying for jobs. No one voted for this. Yet British taxpayers are forced to fund it. The British people have been lied to, ignored and betrayed. 
Critical reforms needed in the first 100 days: 

Affirm British Sovereignty. 
Reject the influence of the World Economic Forum. We will cancel our membership of the World Health Organisation unless there is fundamental reform to its structure and funding. Reform UK also opposes the Creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). We will legislate if necessary to stop Britain becoming a cashless society. 

Replace the 2010 Equalities Act. 
The current Equalities Act requires discrimination in the name of ‘positive action’. It costs the economy billions of pounds, and has become a lawyer’s charter to print money. It has destroyed meritocracy, spread division and led to exclusion for some in majority groups. Scrap all Diversity Equality and Inclusion roles that cost huge sums, create division, inequality and exclusion, and reduce productivity. 

Propose a Comprehensive Free Speech Bill. 
Legislate to stop left-wing bias and ‘woke’ ideology. No more de-banking, cancel culture, left wing hate mobs or political bias in public institutions. Stop Sharia law being used in the UK. All public electoral activity including debates leaflets and other information must be in English. 

Commence Reform of the BBC. 
The out-of-touch wasteful BBC is institutionally biased. The TV licence is taxation without representation. In a world of on-demand TV  People should be free to choose. 



Launch a Westminster Anti-Corruption Unit. 
The Covid PPE scandal has raised serious questions about integrity in government. The public watchdog must close the ‘revolving door’ between government and big business. Address potential conflicts of interest. Ask why UK infrastructure costs so much more than other countries. Investigate Chinese espionage and influence over politicians, academics and key decision-makers which the UK Intelligence and Security Committee says is a major threat to national security.
